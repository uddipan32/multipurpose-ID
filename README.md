# Multipurpose-ID
The project is being developed to ease the work of students. The Smart card is nothing but a unique card which assigned to the student. The card will work as, all in one card in college or universities. 
The card can be used as general ID card of a student, hostel card and library card.
The administrator can update results, admission date, notices, library fines etc. in the server and then student can access the server by using the card.Thus the student just needs to carry the one portable card instead of bunch of cards. Hence this card is very beneficial for a student.
The ID card can be generated by the student by logging in using his unique QR code and password which will be provided by the college administration.
